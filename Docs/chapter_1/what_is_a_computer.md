# What is a Computer
## ***A computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data***

**A computer consists of the following major hardware components**

1.  **A central processing unit (CPU)**
2.  **Memory (main memory)**
3.   **Storage devices (such as disks and CDs)** 
4.   **Input devices (such as the mouse and the keyboard)**
5.   **Output devices (such as monitors and printers)** 
6.   **Communication devices (such as modems and network interface cards (NIC))**

***A computer’s components are interconnected by a subsystem called a bus. You can think
of a bus as a sort of system of roads running among the computer’s components; data and
power travel along the bus from one part of the computer to another. In personal computers,***

1. ## Centaral Processing unit
   
    ***The central processing unit (CPU) is the computer’s brain. It retrieves instructions from the
    memory and executes them. The CPU usually has two components: a control unit and an
    arithmetic/logic unit. The control unit controls and coordinates the actions of the other components. The arithmetic/logic unit performs numeric operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and logical operations (comparisons).
    Today’s CPUs are built on small silicon semiconductor chips that contain millions of tiny
    electric switches, called transistors, for processing information.
    Every computer has an internal clock that emits electronic pulses at a constant rate. These
    pulses are used to control and synchronize the pace of operations. A higher clock speed enables
    more instructions to be executed in a given period of time. The unit of measurement of clock
    speed is the hertz (Hz), with 1 Hz equaling 1 pulse per second. In the 1990s, computers measured clock speed in megahertz (MHz), but CPU speed has been improving continuously; the
    clock speed of a computer is now usually stated in gigahertz (GHz). Intel’s newest processors
    run at about 3 GHz.
    CPUs were originally developed with only one core. The core is the part of the processor
    that performs the reading and executing of instructions. In order to increase the CPU processing
    power, chip manufacturers are now producing CPUs that contain multiple cores. A multicore
    CPU is a single component with two or more independent cores. Today’s consumer computers typically have two, three, and even four separate cores. Soon, CPUs with dozens or even
    hundreds of cores will be affordable.***

 1. ## Bits and Bytes
     ***Before we discuss memory, let’s look at how information (data and programs) are stored in
    a computer.
    A computer is really nothing more than a series of switches. Each switch exists in two states:
    on or off. Storing information in a computer is simply a matter of setting a sequence of switches
    on or off. If the switch is on, its value is 1. If the switch is off, its value is 0. These 0s and 1s
    are interpreted as digits in the binary number system and are called bits (binary digits).
    The minimum storage unit in a computer is a byte. A byte is composed of eight bits. A small
    number such as 3 can be stored as a single byte. To store a number that cannot fit into a single
    byte, the computer uses several bytes.
    Data of various kinds, such as numbers and characters, are encoded as a series of bytes. As
    a programmer, you don’t need to worry about the encoding and decoding of data, which the
    computer system performs automatically, based on the encoding scheme. An encoding scheme
    is a set of rules that govern how a computer translates characters and numbers into data with
    which the computer can actually work. Most schemes translate each character into a***

    ***predetermined string of bits. In the popular ASCII encoding scheme, for example, the character
    C is represented as 01000011 in 1 byte.
    A computer’s storage capacity is measured in bytes and multiples of the byte, as follows:***

      1. **A kilobyte (KB) is about 1,000 bytes.**
      2. **A megabyte (MB) is about 1 million bytes.**
      3. **A gigabyte (GB) is about 1 billion bytes.**
      4. **A terabyte (TB) is about 1 trillion bytes.**

    ***A typical one-page word document might take 20 KB. Therefore, 1 MB can store 50 pages
    of documents, and 1 GB can store 50,000 pages of documents. A typical two-hour highresolution movie might take 8 GB, so it would require 160 GB to store 20 movies.***
